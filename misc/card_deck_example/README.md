# Card Deck Example

This is a learning example which builds a card deck and does a few things with it.

It show how to build two tuples (VALUES and TYPES), and then combine the elements through a cartesian product into a full deck.

It then shows how to find the size (len) of the deck, iterates through the deck showing each card, and selects a random card.
